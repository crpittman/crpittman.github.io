	<p>I am currently a 4th year PhD student at the University of Central Florida. I am a member of the Interactive Systems
	& User Experiences Lab under the mentorship of Dr. Joseph LaViola. My research interesting include augmented reality,
	novel input methods, and robotics, though I have been known to dabble in other areas relating to HCI and data visualization.</p>
	<p>Outside of research, I am an avid fitness junky. My main focuses are distance running and bouldering, with cycling and yoga
	helping to round everything off.</p>
